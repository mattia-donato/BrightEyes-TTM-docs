# Welcome to BrightEyes-TTM's documentation!

The BrightEyes-TTM is an open-source project which consists in a data-acquisition card able to implement the so-called photon time-tagging acquisition mode with a time resolution of ~30ps designed microscopy based on a commercial Xilinx Kintex-7 KC-705 evaluation board.

The BrightEyes-TTM project born as an offshoot of the BrighEyes project founded by the ERC in 2018 (Consolidator Grant, N. 818699). The principal aim of the BrightEyes-TTM project is to give to any microscopy laboratory the possibility to implement and further develop single-photon microscopy. The second aim is to trigger the interest of the microscopy community, and establish the BrigthEyes-TTM as a new standard for single-photon laser scanning microscopy (LSM) experiments.

```{note}
There are two version of BrightEyes-TTM. The article on arXiv is referred to the version v1.0, the article published is refered to the version v2.0.
